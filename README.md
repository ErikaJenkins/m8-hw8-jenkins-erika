//ISSUES - I had issues with trying to make the code continue to show the submenu links until after you moused off the links. My code hides the submenus as soon as you mouse off the menu link. I wasn't sure if that's how this homework is supposed to go. But I wanted to make this work as a real menu with sub menus to use for future web designs. I left code snippets that I tried as comments on my main.js page. Hope you can provide some guidance.
